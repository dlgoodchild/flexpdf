# FlexPDF
FlexPDF is a fork of the FPDF/tFPDF library. It's name comes from a 3 minute decision
based on having a flexible PDF library. This library has the following objectives:

1. Strictly typed in accordance with PHP 7
2. Kept up to date with the latest PHP version (currently v7.1)
3. Use a fluid interface
4. Callbacks in favour of inheritance (see Header and Footer for FPDF)
5. Composer support (unlike FPDF as of Sept 2016)
6. To be supported with an active test suite.
7. To separate the use of the PDF language from the construction in PHP.
8. To consider PSR adoption where applicable
9. To simplify PDF generation

If you have any suggestions or feedback please fire it along and I'll do my best to consider or address it.
